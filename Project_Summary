# Call Center Analysis

ServiceSpot, an IT company, contacted you in order to help them analyze their call center data.
They receive daily calls from their customers and would like to know how things are going.
The data is split across multiple files, and they are unable to make good use of it.
Your mission is to provide them with a complete solution which will help them analyze data through nice looking reports. Power BI seems to be the perfect tool for that mission (what a coincidence) !

Goals of the project :
•	Retrieve data from the many sources
•	Apply necessary transformations in Power Query
•	Design a proper data model
•	Create any necessary measure that will answer business questions
•	Design a nice-looking report, that provides all the answers the business needs (and even more !)

Report expectations :
The report pages must provide answers to the following questions :
•	How many calls (% of total calls) are answered within the SLA (see “remarks” below) for each employee ?
•	What is the average call time by employee ?
•	What are the managers whose team answer most calls ? 
•	What is the average waiting time for each time of the day ?
o	Morning (6am – 12am), Afternoon (12am – 8pm), Night (8pm – 6am)
•	Which states are generating the most revenue ?
•	What is the day of the week when the company receives most calls ? And the least calls ?
•	What is the average time before a call gets abandoned by the customer, for each call type ?
